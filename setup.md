title: Setup
---

Prior to the workshop you will need to setup a free account for [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/)
or (_preferentially_) on the local EMBL instance [git.embl.de](https://git.embl.de/).

Please see [this section of the workshop template][workshop-setup]
for instructions on installing Git.

We'll do our work in the `Desktop` folder so make sure you change your working directory to it with:

~~~
$ cd
$ cd Desktop
~~~
{: .language-bash}
