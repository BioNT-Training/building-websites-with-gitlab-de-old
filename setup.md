title: Setup
---

Prior to the workshop you will need to setup a free account for [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/)
or (_preferentially_) on the local EMBL instance [git.embl.de](https://git.embl.de/).

In addition, [__pip__](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) should be installed in your machine.
